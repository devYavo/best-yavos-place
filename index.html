            I decided enough was enough with factory work and wanted to
            do something I actually enjoy doing. I have been taking
            courses through codefinity, using a coding app on my phone, watching tips and using VSCode to do walkthrough projects from YouTube
            and I'm really focused on changing my 
            career path. One thing I might do since it's still early is try 
            a different coding website. Maybe <a class="link"
            href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">codecademy</a> 
            might be another good one to learn from. But the absolute best thing 
            I've found so far is an app called <a class="link" target="_blank" 
            href="https://mimo.org/blog/mimo-review-the-mobile-app-the-bootcamp-the-web-app">
            mimo</a>. I downloaded it straight to my phone and it really has 
            been helping me retain the information that I'm learning.

            I graduated high school in 1997 and just kinda breezed through
            life with no direction or asperations to try anything. I'm not
            sure if 'breezed' would be the right way to put it. I've really
            had to bust my butt to get to where I'm at. But all I
            wanted to do was hang out with my friends and party. So I always
            bounced from job to job never knowing what I wanted to do. And
            since I did not go to college, it made my job choices pretty 
            slim.
        </p>

        <p>
            Stock boy at a grocery store, fast food, and a clerk at 
            a bait shop before I was 19. Then it was stocking ice cream 
            trucks on overnights until I found my first warehouse job; when 
            I was around 19. Keep in mind, I didn't hold down any of these 
            jobs for more than a year. Nothing felt right. Then a friend 
            of a friend told me I should learn electrical and come work for 
            him. So I kept that for about 2 years and decided that wasn't what 
            I wanted to be doing either. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So there I was, riding the couch because I just didn't know what 
            to do to get me excited to get up in the morning. I couldn't ride 
            it for long, seeing as I had bills to pay and didn't want to be 
            homeless, so I applied at Hell. And even though I hated it, I stuck 
            it out for 7 years until I was able to find another warehouse job 
            that paid a little more. Kept that for about 2 years and life 
            circumstances took me out of state to basically start over.
        </p>

        <p>
            So I'm in a new area and the only thing I can do is look for 
            warehouse work because that's what is going to pay the most in the 
            area. I kept the first one for a year and a half and couldn't do 
            it anymore. So I tried my luck with electrical again. Held that for 
            4 years but then Covid hit and I didn't want to go into people's 
            crawlspaces and attics anymore so it was back to warehouse work.
        </p>

        <p>
            And that's where I'm at today. Another warehouse job that makes me 
            hate waking up in the morning. So I started web development courses 
            at the end of Feb. 2024 and it feels like the thing that I've been missing 
            my whole life. I remember a question they used to ask in school, "If 
            you won the lottery, and didn't have to worry about money, what would 
            you want to do?". I've never had an answer to that question until now.<br>
            Just wanted to add that I'm learning web development, not grammer and punctuation. HAHAHAHA!!
